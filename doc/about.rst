About eTraGo
============

Optimization of flexibility options for transmission grids based on PyPSA.

A speciality in this context is that transmission grids are described by the
380, 220 and 110 kV in Germany. Conventionally the 110kV grid is part of the
distribution grid. The integration of the transmission and 'upper' distribution
grid is part of eTraGo.

The focus of optimization are flexibility options with a special focus on
energy storages and grid expansion measures.


The open_eGo project
====================
This software project is part of the research project
`open_eGo <https://openegoproject.wordpress.com>`_.


The OpenEnergy Platform
=======================
With in this project we developted the OpenEnergy Platform which this software
is using in order to get and store the in- and output data. Before you start to
calculate a registration on the platform is needed. For more see
